                    At DK Cycle Shop, our journey began with a passion for cycling and a dream to create a place where fellow enthusiasts could find high-quality bikes and build a community around this shared love. Founded by Davi Komura, the shop was born out of a desire to offer more than just bicyclesâ€”we wanted to provide an experience that inspires people to embrace the joy of cycling, whether for sport, commuting, or recreation.
